Shark Changelog
===============
##v2.0.9 - Oct 19, 2016
Fixed a bug where the high velocity calls to the orm from dispatched blocks, which were inadvertantly accessing some static variables caused the main thread to block forever and would never release.
Upgraded to SQLite 3.15.0 - Took 3 seconds off our performance test, which is a 10k random read-write routine, across multiple tables with multiple record shapes and event trigers.  Was 15.03s now 11.98s.

##v2.0.8 - Aug 03, 2016
####Added Object dot notation support to query syntax

Developers can now access the properties of related objects from within the *where* clause of a query, such as the following.  If we take the example of a Person class which is related to the Department class via the `department` property.
    
```swift
Person.query().whereWithFormat("department.name = %@", withParameters: ["Test Department"]).fetch()
```
Where `name` is within a related object, SharkORM will now automatically re-arrange the query and join the two tables on that relationship and therefore validate that condition.
    
Updated to SQLite v3.13.0

Better support of UUID primary keys in many scenarios.

Change [SRKResultSet removeAll] to return a BOOL value indicating the success of the operation to remain consistent with other read/write operations.


##v2.0.7 - July 24, 2016
Fixed a bug where the cached property types of an SRKObject did not contain a data type for the Id column.

##v2.0.6 - July 17, 2016
Fixed an issue with circular commit chains, SRKObjects can now be arranged with complicated relationships such as A-B-C-B.  But also with A-C as well, causing a quad point relationship within a single commit.

SRKObject’s now implement a class method ‘ignoreProperties’.  Which
allows developers to choose which properties to ignore.

##v2.0.5 - June 29, 2016
Fixed crash when printing an object without an primary key value.  No Null check was made.
Fixed serious issue, where SRKObject properties were being persisted. Causing query errors.

##v2.0.4 - June 24, 2016

Added support for Raw Queries, Inherritance support & Carthage support.

Raw query example:
```objective-c
SRKRawResults* results = [SharkORM rawQuery:@"SELECT * FROM Person ORDER BY age;"];
```

##v2.0.3 - June 20, 2016
Added more tests, changed print output of a class to output in the style of the following.
```
{
    entity = Person;
    joins =     {
    };
    "pk column" = Id;
    "pk value" = 36664;
    properties =     (
                {
            name = Id;
            type = number;
            value = 36664;
        },
                {
            name = payrollNumber;
            type = number;
            value = 0;
        },
                {
            name = age;
            type = number;
            value = 36;
        },
                {
            name = Name;
            type = unset;
            value = "<null>";
        },
                {
            name = location;
            type = unset;
            value = "<null>";
        },
                {
            name = department;
            type = unset;
            value = "<null>";
        },
                {
            name = seq;
            type = number;
            value = 0;
        }
    );
    relationships =     (
                {
            property = department;
            status = unloaded;
            target = Department;
        },
                {
            property = location;
            status = unloaded;
            target = Location;
        }
    );
}
```

##v2.0.2 - June 19, 2016
Updated the podspec, pushed a new version due to a problem merging a pull request

##v2.0.1 - June 18, 2016
JOIN: Added join tests & fixed bugs with join.
This turned up some faults when you wanted to Query C From A through a B join.  So, if you specifically specified the FQ field name it failed, because the ORM attemoted to prepend the self.class name.

Structure:
[Person]->[Deaprtment]->[Location]

Code example:
```objective-c
Person * p = [[[[[Person query]
                    joinTo:[Department class] leftParameter:@"department" targetParameter:@"Id"]
                    joinTo:[Location class] leftParameter:@"Department.location" targetParameter:@"Id"]
                     fetch]
               firstObject];
```


Fixed framework build output to include x86_64 in the available architectures

##v2.0.0 - June 16, 2016
Initial check in.  Replaces the DBAccess project from v1.6.13
